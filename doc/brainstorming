OUR STORY:

1. sign in or register
2. register: multistep form to create username/pw, authenticate coderwall, treehouse, codeschool, blog link (    all profile urls, like flatiron survery)- save and populates where it can given JSON responses
  - invited to a specific group via email.
  - front and backend validation.
3. Home page of team- main leader board. with link to your own profile as well as other students pages
4. profile pages. 

goals:
-the stars- normalizing the data. Assume there is only one user. how do i make stars out of them, what does that look like, how do i automate that.
- then add another user.
- admin can give students stars to give to other students. 

users and stars in general- define star API.
stars are cononical. star called "first one in"
stars are an activerecord class. id and name.  
- stars from pragmatic events
- stars from students and teachers- funny and with text and whatever.

model that correlations events to stars and stars to block of code.

star who's event is a code school badge. and actual block of code that calls codeschool. to create the badge for the event.

rest and background job processing. 


*internal service. flatiron rss that is just a component that is really great at one thing, great at rss feeds
-encapsulate that as a service in and of itself
  - same thing with twitter and github. 
  - service oriented architecture that provide a simple API so not ever application has to build wrapper for all of these. 
  -interacting with those services and not our own classes.
